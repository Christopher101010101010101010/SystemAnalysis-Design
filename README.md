# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
In the DriverPass project, the client is a small driving education company with a half-dozen or so driving instructors, an IT officer, a secretary and the company's owner as staff members. The DriverPass company has requested designs for an academic software package focused on their customers' accessing the system to view practice RMV exams, schedule  on-the-road driving instruction sessions and purchase academic tier upgrades.

# What did you do particularly well?
Given restrictions on development in a free Lucidchart account, I would agrue that my UML diagrams are my best work given my attention to detail when considering the relationships between actors and the various activities of this software package.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Given extra time to revise my work, I would return to Project One: Business Requirements Document to consider the Functional Requirements of the project in greater depth, such as Storage Space requirements for the Cloud Provider, local memory requirements for users accessing the system and network latency requirements. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When considering the client's needs I refer to the DriverPass Transcript inwhich the owner, Liam, specifies that he needs a system that will allow his customers to view a personalized profile that will link to practice RMV exams, display scores from past practice RMV exams, display past on-the-road driving instruction sessions, allow students to schedule new on-the-road driving instruction sessions, and give students access to academic tier upgrades. Additionally Liam had requested that the company secretary be given privileges to schedule on-the-road sessions for students, driving instructors be given privileges to grade students on-the-roads and the Administrator of this system, Liam and his IT Officer, Ian, be given complete access to the system. It is paramount to consider the client's needs when developing their system given that this system a custom build for the DriverPass company and any miscommunication regarding system requirements could create a necessity for major revisions to the system late in development that will cost the team unpredictable amounts of time and energy.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software it is vital to initially determine the client's functionality requirements and GUI style preferences, and secondly to develop a UML Activtity Diagram, UML Sequence Diagrams and a UML Class Diagram to ensure a clear path to the proper implementation of the system.
